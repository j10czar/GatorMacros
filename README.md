# Gator Macros 🍽️

[GatorMacros Website](https://j10czar.github.io/GatorMacros/)

Gator Macros is a dynamic web tool built for University of Florida students who care about fitness and nutrition. It helps you track whether you're hitting your protein and calorie goals based on what's currently being served at UF dining halls.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Calculates your protein and calorie intake from real-time dining hall menus  
- 🧠 Smart meal plan generator based on your specific nutrition targets  
- 🐊 Clean, intuitive interface optimized for student use  
- 💪 Built to support student athletes and gym-goers looking for a diet edge

## 🔍 How It Works

Gator Macros pulls data directly from UF’s dining hall API to show you what’s on the menu and helps you build custom meals that match your nutrition goals.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The dining hall menus are synced through UF’s API, which occasionally changes access keys without notice. When this happens, the site might temporarily display dining halls as "closed" even when they're open. We're automatically notified when this occurs and typically patch it fast — so just know it's a known issue and not a bug in the app itself.

## 📦 Built With

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Figma (for design mockups)  
- Postman (for API testing)
